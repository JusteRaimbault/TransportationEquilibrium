Juste Raimbault is a PhD candidate in geography, at Géographie-cités laboratory in Paris (UMR CNRS 8504 Géographie-cité, Paris, France - supervision by HDR A. Banos) and at LVMT laboratory (UMR-T 9403 IFSTTAR, Champs-sur-Marne, France - supervision by MCF F. Le Nechet).
Trained as an engineer at Ecole Polytechnique (Palaiseau, France) and at Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées (Champs-sur-Marne, France) with a specialty in urban systems (department City, Environment, Transportation), he also holds a Msc in Complex Systems Science from Ecole Polytechnique. This multidisciplinary formation is the source of multiple research interests linked to the application of Complex Systems methods to the study of urban systems (ranging from the modeling of urban growth to the empirical study of transportation systems).
His thesis is focused on the study of Interactions between Networks and Territories, questioning in particular the construction of models for the co-evolution of land-use and transportation systems.
He also currently works on interdisciplinary collaborations from a Complex Systems Science perspective (in very different fields such as Ecology, Evidence-based Economics, Quantitative Finance, Urbanism, Epistemology).
